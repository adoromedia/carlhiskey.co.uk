# Mobile Sports Therapist based in London and Hertfordshire

I am a mobile Sports Therapist based in Northwest London and Hertfordshire specifically dedicated to the prevention of injury and the rehabilitation of the patient, bringing them back to optimum levels of functional, occupational and sports specific fitness, regardless of age and ability.

## More than just sports injuries

Sports Therapy is not just restricted to treating sports injuries. I have over 9 yearsâ€™ experience treating work related, common everyday injuries and post operative patients.

Sports Therapy utilises the principles of sport and exercise sciences incorporating physiological and pathological processes to prepare the patient for training, competition and where applicable, work.

## House visits for your convenience

The majority of my patients are seen via a house visit, however appointments are available at a local clinic in Stanmore on request, to make it easy for those that commute to work or would prefer a consultation away from the home environment.

## What conditions can a Sports Therapist treat?

- Joint Injuries
- Ligament Injuries
- Muscle Tears / Tension
- Back Pain
- Post operation recovery
- Knee/Hip replacements
- Neck Pain
- Other Sports Related Injuries
- Arthritis
- Overuse injuries / RSI
- Plus much more

## What does a consultation consist of?

Prior to any form of treatment I will take a full medical history, which involves asking questions about previous injuries and your current state of health. There after a full assessment of the presenting ailment will be under taken. Looking at the range of movement, any restrictions, pain and muscle tone.
If any special tests are required including neurological and muscle testing they will be done to see the integrity of that particular muscle, joint, ligament and tendon.

If there are no contraindications to treatment we can proceed after consent.

Treatment may include myofascial release, trigger point treatment, sports massage, stretching, manipulation and/or mobilisation.

Additionally for Rehabilitation purposes I use:

- Cryocuff treatment
- Therabands
- Kinesiology tape
- Tens Machine

An explanation of what the problem is will be thoroughly clarified with the expected time of recovery.
