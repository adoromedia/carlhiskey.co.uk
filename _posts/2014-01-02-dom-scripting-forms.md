The HTML DOM has dedicated APIs for retrieving and manipulating forms and controls. Itâ€™s always important to use the right API and in this case the DOM 0 API [[0](#ref0)] Forms collection is appropriate but unfortunately often forgotten.

There are just a few simple ways to script your forms. Let's dive in:

## Accessing a form

Accessing a form with a name attribute 'login' is as follows:

	var loginForm = document.forms.login;

## Accessing form controls

Once we have the form we can retrieve all the controls in a form:

	var loginControls = loginForm.elements;

Note: If the login form contained a username and password control then `loginControls` would be a collection of two controls.

## Accessing a control by name

There are several types of control: input, select, textarea, etc. Having retrieved the controls earlier we can loop over each control or retrieve a particular control by index or name. Retrieving a control by name is as follows:

	var usernameControl = loginControls.username;

## Inspecting a control value

Once we have a control we can interrogate its value:

	var usernameValue = usernameControl.value;

This is useful if you want to perform client side validation, for example.
