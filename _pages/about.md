# About

I am a qualified Sports Therapist (BSc Hons) who graduated from the University of Hertfordshire in 2005, holding full membership with The Society of Sports Therapists, along with the industry’s Professional Liability Insurance.

I have experience working with both elite and recreational athletes through Fulham Football Clubs Academy, local semi-professional football clubs, John Fisher School of Rugby and athletes from other sports including gymnastics, dance, athletics and martial arts backgrounds. I am also a qualified gym instructor.

Additionally I have more than 9 years’ experience of treating clients with a wide range of vocational injuries from builders to office workers.

Personally I have an all-round interest in health and fitness, exercise physiology and nutrition.
